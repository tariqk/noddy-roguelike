"""This module implements the tiles interface, and serves as a bridge
between both viewport.py and game.py. Or something. I'm still figuring
this out.

The design of this class currently comes from Yannick Loiseau's
â€œDesign Patterns and Python: Flyweight page:

http://yloiseau.net/articles/DesignPatterns/flyweight/

Specifically, this is the Mixin class version, which should allow me
to easily subclass and introspect better than other version.
